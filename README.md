Automated subtitle renaming tool

Tired of renaming dozens of subtitles?
Want a simple click to rename your Breaking Bad subtitles?
Behold, the Subtitle Click is here!

<b>Instructions</b>

This is a little project which I find to be the my most useful one until today.
Normally I deal with abstract math problems, searching, sorting etc. but this one project has none of those and it has an actual use.

Happy renaming
