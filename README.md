#Subtitle-Click
One-click subtitle renaming tool

Tired of renaming dozens of files?
<br>
Want a simple click to rename your Breaking Bad subtitles?
<br>
Behold, the Subtitle Click is here!

<b>Instructions</b>
<ul><b>1. </b>Simply copy the python file in a folder containing video files and subtitle files</ul>
<ul><b>2. </b>Execute the file</ul>
<ul><b>3. </b>???</ul>
<ul><b>4. Profit</b></ul>

<b>Note:</b> Requires Python to be installed, <i>obviously</i>

This is a little project which I find to be the my most useful one until today.
Normally I deal with abstract math problems, searching, sorting etc. but this one project has none of those and it has an actual use.

Happy renaming
